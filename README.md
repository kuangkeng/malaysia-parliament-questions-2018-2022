About the datasets

The datasets in this repository are parf of Greenpeace Malaysia's project (https://www.greenpeace.org/malaysia/act/undi-iklim/) to analyse how Malaysian MPs (Members of Parliament) recognise, care and talk about climate change and environmental destruction in the Parliament.

There are 2 datasets. The first one, questions_all.csv, contains all the questions (and answers for certain types of questions) asked by the MPs in the Dewan Rakyat (lower house) of the 14th Parliament. The questions were scrapped from all the parliamentary question transcripts (Hansard documents) between 2018 and October 2022 available to be downloaded from the Parliament website (https://www.parlimen.gov.my/).

The questions were raised by the MPS in 5 different channels - non-verbal questions (soalan bukan lisan), verbal questions (soalan lisan), special chamber (kamar khas), Minister Question Time (MQT) and official hansard (penyata rasmi).

For the second dataset, environmental-related-questions-2018-2022.csv, it was a filtered dataset from the first dataset based on specific keywords linked to environmental topics. Please see the README.md in the subfolder of the dataset for more details.

The scrapping was done by Kuek Ser Kuang Keng (Data-N) and further cleaning was done by Margo Prebenda (Greenpeace Southeast Asia).
